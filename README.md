# Machine Learning Model Comparison in Python and Julia

## Introduction

This README provides an overview of a project where we build machine learning (ML) models in Python and Julia using the scikit-learn library. The primary objective of this project is to compare the performance of ML models implemented in both programming languages and identify which language is better suited for specific types of models.
